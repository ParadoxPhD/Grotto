This is a social media app that will eventually be designed to combine the messaging features of a regular social media app with extended browser features.
This will allow the user to browse the internet and share content directly to their social timeline, as well as instant viewing of others' shared content.
This way, users have a seamless experience between content and talking about that content, without having to switch between apps.

This won't be a client for another service, though.

Anyway, this is in super early stages and doesn't do anything useful, but feel free to point and laugh at my bad code as I slwoly make it usable.
